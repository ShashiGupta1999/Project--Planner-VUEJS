This is a SPA FOR PROJECT MANAGEMENT built using the vuejs framework 

Technologies Used:

Vue 3 (Composition API)

Vue Router

json-server (for local REST API)

Jest & Vue Test Utils (for unit testing)

How it works:

Users can add new projects with a title and details.

Projects can be marked as complete or ongoing.

Projects can be edited or deleted.

Navigation and filtering are handled with Vue Router.

All project data is fetched and updated via REST API calls to the local json-server backend.
